This is the second tutorial of Make School's full-stack web series! In this tutorial, we'll look at the bigger picture of full-stack web development. We'll cover the tools and technologies we'll use and how they all fit together (to build web apps).

# Who Is This For?

Beginners (little to no previous coding experience) who want to learn full-stack web development.

## What You Should Already Know

Nothing. As long as you're excited to learn how to build web apps, you're golden!

## Estimated Completion Time:

10 minutes

# What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- understand (on a high level) how the internet works
- know how each technology works together to build a web app
- observe network traffic in real-time
- learn to inspect the source code of a web page

# Important: Read Me!

Now that I have your attention...

To succeed as an full-stack web developer and build awesome web apps, you'll need to know more than just code. This tutorial will introduce new topics like _How the Internet Works_ and _Chrome Developer Tools_, many which don't involve writing code. This might seem irrelevant at first, however you won't be able to get far building web apps without a solid understanding of these subjects first.

Most importantly, make sure you're having fun. Building web apps is challenging, but also extremely rewarding. There's no feeling quite like watching something you've created come to life and feeling the pride from knowing you built it yourself!

# If You Get Stuck

Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, pause for a moment and take a breath. Maybe take a walk. Then retrace your steps (in the tutorial, not the walk). Make sure you've followed each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or accidentally skip over important steps.
