Congrats! You've made it through your first tutorial.

You taken your first steps on your journey to become an full-stack developer.

In this tutorial, you built a "big picture" mental model for _How the Internet Works_.

We learned about how our technology stack fits into our model of the internet and which technologies make up the front-end, back-end and full-stack.

To wrap up, we used the _Chrome Developer Tools_ (DevTools) to zoom in on the HTTP request/response cycle as well as the code displayed by the browser.

## Where To Go From Here?

If it went by in a blur, don't worry. These concepts will continue to click and become reinforced as you learn more about full-stack web development.

As you progress through this tutorial series, you can use this mental model to remember what you're building and how it fits into the big picture:

In the upcoming tutorial, we'll focus on the front-end technologies HTML and CSS. We'll learn about the syntax of these technologies, what they do and use them to build a _static_ landing page!
