Before we start, we'll need to install the popular web browser: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

You're probably familiar with the web browser. In fact, right now, you're viewing this tutorial through a web browser.

A browser allows you to view websites on the internet, but it'll also allow us to view, test and interact with the code we're going to write.

# Why Google Chrome?

Google Chrome is a popular choice for many web developers. Not only is it available on every major platform, it also has a whoppin' 58.9% market share. That means roughly 60% of users will visit your website through a Chrome browser, with Firefox trailing in second place at 13.3%.

You might not know this, but each different web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) will display the code of a website a little differently. We want to use Chrome as we test and develop because it'll allow us to make sure the wide majority (holy 60%!) have a good user experience.

What is does *user experience* mean?
>
In product development, the term user experience, or UX, is used to describe how a user feels after interacting with a product or service. When you start building, try to keep your users in mind and think about how they'll feel when using your web apps.

Another reason many developers prefer Chrome is because of _Chrome Developer Tools_. Dev tools, as the name implies, are tools for developers. They allow us to view, test and interact with our code in the Chrome browser. Google has invested a lot of time and resources into creating their dev tools. We'll learn more about them in the section _Chrome Developer Tools_.
