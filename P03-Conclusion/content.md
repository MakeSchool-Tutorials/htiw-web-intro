In this tutorial, you built a "big picture" mental model for _How the Internet Works_.

We learned about how our technology stack fits into our model of the internet and which technologies make up the front-end, back-end and full-stack.

To wrap up, we used the _Chrome Developer Tools_ (DevTools) to zoom in on the HTTP request/response cycle as well as the code displayed by the browser.

## Where To Go From Here?

As you progress through this tutorial series, you can use this mental model to remember what you're building and how it fits into the big picture:

In the upcoming tutorial, we'll add to our front-end technologies by learning how to utilize client-side JavaScript. We'll learn about how to implement logic using code by building a game of concentration!
